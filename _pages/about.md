Bringing Europeans Together Association Netherlands (BETA Netherlands) is a non-profit national youth association founded in November 2018 by a group of young, capable and ambitious individuals who had the ultimate goal of bringing Model European Union simulations to Netherlands, the one of the founding countries of the European Union.BETA Netherlands is also the official Dutch branch of the European federal association based in Brussels, Bringing Europeans Together Association Europe (BETA Europe).

**Our Goals**

The purpose of the association is to promote mutual understanding and cooperation between young Europeans and to contribute to the spreading of European ideas. It aims to achieve this goal by organising political simulations on local, regional and European level that mirror the functioning of the institutions of the EU end the legislative procedure of the EU for educational purposes. The association will organise events such as “Model European Union The Netherlands” (“MEUNL”). MEUNL will be organised every year and is an international conference for youth from Europe and outside of Europe from a broad range of academic educations. Furthermore the Associations will contribute to the exchange of knowledge with other organisations that organise similar events.


**MEU The Netherlands**

 The flagship project of BETA Netherlands is Model European Union The Netherlands (MEU The Netherlands) which is scheduled to premiere in July 2019. The project aims to promote knowledge of the decision-making process, representing the way new EU legislation comes to force while fostering mutual understanding and cooperation through debate and dialogue amidst youth within Netherlands and Europe.
